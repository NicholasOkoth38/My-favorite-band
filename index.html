            <p> The members of PRETTYMUCH were pursuing solo careers until Simon Cowell and Sonny Takhar decided to bring them together and form a group. All the members of PRETTYMUCH, since 2016, have been 
                based in Los Angeles where they all live together while recording their debut album. The album, to be released on Columbia Records and executive producer Savan Kotecha, features a guest appearance 
                by French Montana on one track and a song written by Ed Sheeran.</p>

    <h1>More on the band </h1>
            <p>PRETTYMUCH gained a following on social media with their cover songs and dancing videos, 
                including a rendition of Julia Michael's "Issues" and choreography tributes to Bruno Mars and Michael Jackson.
                In July 2017, their debut single, "Would You Mind", written by Savan Kotecha and Jacob Kasher, was released and a month later, the group performed the song at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards.
                Their music video for the song was released in September. The video was inspired by boy band videos of the late 90s and early 2000s like N'Sync and Backstreet Boys. The boys also have matching tattoos
                .III.XVIII.XVI. It means 3-18-16 which was the date the band was formed.

                PRETTYMUCH is my favorite band because they different from other musicians and their style tend to be unique,exciting and quite entertaining.
